The most important quality in a startup founder is determination. Not intelligence—determination. Intelligence is nice to have, but you don’t need it to succeed. Determination is necessary because startups are hard. It takes determination to work on a problem for years without getting paid for it. It takes determination to keep going when your friends and family think you’re crazy. And it takes determination to keep going when investors turn you down.

But determination alone is not enough. We look for three other qualities in founders: flexibility, naivete, and ferociousness.

Flexibility means being open to change. Successful founders have a vision, but they’re also willing to change that vision as they learn more about their customers and their market. They’re not afraid to pivot if their initial idea doesn’t work out.

Naivete means not knowing what can’t be done. If you knew how hard it was to start a successful startup, you might never start one. Successful founders are often first-time founders who don’t know any better. They have a naivete that allows them to take risks and try things that more experienced founders might not.

Ferociousness means being aggressive and tenacious. Successful founders are not passive. They are not afraid to fight for their vision and to do whatever it takes to make it a reality. They have a sense of urgency and a willingness to work hard and take risks.

We also look for founders who are working on problems they are passionate about. Startups are hard, and if you’re not passionate about what you’re working on, it’s going to be even harder. You’re going to have to work on this problem for years, so you better love it.

Finally, we look for founders who are capable of building a great team. No founder can do it all alone. You need to be able to recruit, motivate, and manage a team of talented people. And you need to be able to inspire them to share your vision and work together to make it a reality.

In summary, the most important quality in a startup founder is determination. But determination alone is not enough. We also look for founders who are flexible, naive, and ferocious. Founders who are passionate about their work and capable of building a great team. If you have these qualities, we want to talk to you.
